Project 1 Title
===============

-   **Class:** CSCI 301 Survey of Scripting Languages

## Project description

When the program first runs, it outputs a set of test values which are used to demonstrate that the functions are all working properly (see Fig 1). After this the user is prompted to input values for side A and B which are the two sides that connect at a right angle. The program then uses these values to compute the value side C which is the hypotenuse and the surface area of the triangle (see Fig 2).

## How to compile / run the program

Navigate to the directory which contains the program. Compile and run using the following command.

```bash
python RightTriangle.py
```
